Empire market - the leading Darknet market - is under constant DDoS and it is virtually impossible to have any stable access there. There are some other markets in the Darknet but they are usually quite small and every other day there is some exit scam. That is why I don't post any Darknet market links right now. However due to this situation vendors increasingly set their own shops in the Clearnet and I have given links to some.
